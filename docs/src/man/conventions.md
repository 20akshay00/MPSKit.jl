# Conventions

MPSKit is build on top of TensorKit, which in turn defines general (codomain ‚Üê domain) tensormaps.
It is necessary to concretely define what we should consider an mps tensor (for example - what leg is its physical leg?), a bond tensor, and an mpo tensor.

## MPS tensors

The general definition of an mps tensor is as follows

mps tensors are well defined for any amount of physical legs and InfiniteMPS/FiniteMPS handle these general N-leg tensors just fine. This is necessary in for example peps code, where the number of physical spaces of a boundary mps tensor is 2.

However our operators MPOHamiltonian/DenseMPO both only work on mps tensors with one leg. There is no fundamental problem, anyone is free to implement new operators working on the more general mps tensors.

## Bond tensors

The mps bond tensors are square tensormaps, mapping a virtual space to the same virtual space.

## MPO tensors

MPO tensors are used in both statistical mechanics problems and in the definition of quantum hamiltonians. Graphically, they can be represented as follows

The numbering of spaces results in an at first glance not very intuitive ordering of (virtual,physical,physical,virtual) spaces.

## Planarity

MPSKit tries to be as planar as possible, braidings are avoided as often as possible. As a result, it can handle anyonic/fermionic symmetries. Behind the scenes we always check if a contraction is done with tensors for which the braiding rules are trivial - and if not we use TensorKit's `@planar` macro. The logic of this switching between normal and planar tensor contractions is contained in a private `@plansor` macro. This is mostly an implementation detail, and the user should not have to worry about this.
